# ImageAI_image prediction - Backend Only. 

This project uses the imageAI libray in conjunction with a Machine Learning Model, mobileNetV2, to predict an image and the probability that prediction is accurate. Machine Learning model can be substituted for a more trained model for greater accurary. 

Technologies used:
  * GitPod.
  * Tensorflow.
  * imageAI.
  * NumPy.
